Sentence-level outputs reveal strong model sensitivity to biased or discriminatory framing, especially in cases where the model detects subtle justice-related inequalities without explicit hate speech. The multi-axis structure demonstrates that ethical harm is not monolithic: many sentences that appear non-toxic still fail justice metrics, highlighting the need for multi-dimensional evaluation beyond standard toxicity checks.\n\nThe UNESCO mapping module provides an interpretable layer on top of the classifier outputs, enabling each detected violation to be aligned with principles such as “Fairness and Non-Discrimination,” “Human Oversight,” or “Do No Harm.” This bridging between machine classification and human ethical frameworks makes the system suitable for real-world policy or governance applications.\n\nArticle-level aggregation shows clear thematic clustering:\nsome documents exhibit concentrated justice violations, while others demonstrate heavy toxicity patterns. The combined risk taxonomy effectively distinguishes documents that are both unfair and offensive—often the most dangerous form of AI-generated misinformation.\n\nOverall, this system demonstrates that ethical risk in AI-generated fake news is multi-dimensional, hierarchical, and often hidden beneath highly fluent text. The architecture provides a practical foundation for future AI safety tools that must detect manipulation, unfair framing, and harmful narratives embedded within synthetic content.

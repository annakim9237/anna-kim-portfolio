Unlike simple motion-following robots, this project focuses on **identity-aware tracking**, meaning the robot only follows a registered person instead of anyone appearing in front of the camera. This capability is achieved through a hybrid perception system combining classical computer vision, deep-learning detection, head-pose analysis, and embedded robot control.\n\nThe robot begins by registering the target user’s face using Haar Cascade detection.

When the target’s face becomes occluded or leaves the camera view, the robot switches to **YOLOv8 full-body tracking**, maintaining pursuit until the face reappears. This multimodal pipeline ensures reliable tracking even in difficult visual conditions.\n\nMovement decisions are derived from the target’s horizontal offset from the frame center and the apparent face size relative to distance.

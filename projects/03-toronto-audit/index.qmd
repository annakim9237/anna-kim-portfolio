## Overview
This project analyzes Toronto’s annual building evaluation data to identify audit risks and support regulatory decision-making. By combining SQL-based filtering, exploratory analyses, and supervised machine learning models, the study offers a data-driven approach to predicting high-risk buildings.

## What I Did
- Conducted exploratory analysis on Toronto’s building audit dataset using SQL and Python to identify structural, financial, and environmental risk indicators.
- Developed machine learning models (Random Forest, Decision Tree) to classify high-risk buildings and guide audit prioritization.
- Applied SMOTE to improve predictive performance by addressing severe class imbalance common in fraud and regulatory datasets.
- Designed geospatial and statistical visualizations using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Folium to communicate insights clearly.
- Summarized results through Streamlit dashboards and PowerPoint presentations for audit teams and stakeholders.

## Methods & Tools
Python · Pandas · NumPy · SQL · Seaborn · Matplotlib · Folium · Streamlit · Random Forest · Decision Tree · SMOTE

## Key Results
- Improved fraud detection and audit targeting by correcting class imbalance and enhancing model accuracy.
- Identified key predictors of high-risk buildings, informing more efficient audit resource allocation.
- Delivered visual dashboards and reports that simplified interpretation of complex regulatory data.

## Impact
This project provides a scalable and actionable framework for regulatory audits, enabling departments to detect at-risk buildings early and conduct data-informed inspections.

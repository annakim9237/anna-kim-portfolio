## Overview
This project evaluates the economic impact of COVID-19 at the U.S. state level by integrating multiple datasets spanning health data, housing markets, labor statistics, GDP, income, and household debt. Using R and tidyverse tools, the analysis compares pre-pandemic (2017–2019) and post-pandemic (2020–2022) trends to reveal structural economic shifts.

## What I Did
- Gathered and merged over ten datasets from CDC, Zillow, BEA, BLS, and the New York Fed, covering COVID cases, housing prices, GDP, unemployment, income, and household debt.
- Performed extensive data cleaning and cross-timeframe alignment to enable fair comparisons between pre-COVID and post-COVID economic conditions.
- Created bar plots, line graphs, and violin plots to visualize changes in spending, debt, income, and unemployment across 50 states.
- Delivered an interactive HTML report summarizing economic trends and identifying states with stronger or weaker resilience during the pandemic.

## Methods & Tools
R · tidyverse · ggplot2 · readxl · RMarkdown · Data Wrangling · Economic Analysis · Visualization

## Key Results
- Revealed clear shifts in consumer spending, income distribution, and labor market stability across states.
- Highlighted states with disproportionate increases in household debt and unemployment.
- Identified divergent housing market trends across regions, informed by integrated Zillow and BEA datasets.

## Impact
This project provides a comprehensive state-level overview of the pandemic’s economic effects and supports evidence-based regional resilience planning.

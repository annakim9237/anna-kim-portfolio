## Overview

The Face Detect Follow Robot is an autonomous human-tracking system that recognizes, identifies, and physically follows a specific user in real time. Unlike simple motion-following robots, this project focuses on **identity-aware tracking**, meaning the robot only follows a registered person instead of anyone appearing in front of the camera. This capability is achieved through a hybrid perception system combining classical computer vision, deep-learning detection, head-pose analysis, and embedded robot control.

The robot begins by registering the target user’s face using Haar Cascade detection. Thirty aligned face images are collected for identity matching. During operation, the system continuously detects faces, extracts features, compares them with the registered target, and only activates “follow mode” after multiple consecutive matches ensure stable identification.

To handle natural human movement—such as turning the head, rotating the face, or temporarily looking away—the system integrates **head pose estimation**, adjusting follow direction based on the nose’s relative position. When the target’s face becomes occluded or leaves the camera view, the robot switches to **YOLOv8 full-body tracking**, maintaining pursuit until the face reappears. This multimodal pipeline ensures reliable tracking even in difficult visual conditions.

Movement decisions are derived from the target’s horizontal offset from the frame center and the apparent face size relative to distance. Commands are transmitted to an Arduino-controlled robot via serial communication, enabling smooth forward, backward, and lateral motion.

Overall, this project demonstrates how classical vision, deep-learning detection, and embedded control can be combined to produce a natural, adaptive, human-aware robotic behavior suitable for personal assistance, education, and security applications.

## System Description

The robot’s perception pipeline integrates:

- **Face registration** using Haar Cascade detection  
- **Face alignment** via eye position normalization  
- **Identity verification** using distance-based comparison  
- **Head pose estimation** via nose deviation  
- **YOLOv8 person detection** as fallback when face is not visible  
- **Serial communication** to coordinate real-time robot motion  

Tracking stability is enhanced through:

- Consecutive match filtering  
- Adaptive thresholds for follow/search states  
- Dynamic YOLO fallback  
- Center-tolerance alignment margins

## Conclusion

The Face Detect Follow Robot demonstrates a practical fusion of classical CV algorithms, deep-learning detection models, and embedded robot communication to achieve identity-specific human tracking. Through multimodal perception—face alignment, head pose estimation, YOLO fallback detection—the robot maintains stable pursuit across varied visual conditions and natural human behavior.

This project highlights the importance of combining **interpretability**, **robustness**, and **real-time performance** in human-centered robotics. While already highly functional, future improvements such as FaceNet embedding-based recognition, ROS navigation, obstacle avoidance, or voice-command integration would further expand its capabilities into a fully autonomous, socially aware robotic system.

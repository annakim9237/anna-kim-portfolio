# Overview

The rapid acceleration of generative AI adoption between 2023 and 2024 transformed online public discourse, with Reddit emerging as one of the most active, diverse, and influential platforms for AI-related conversations. Understanding how large communities react to, critique, and experiment with emerging AI models requires scalable computational methods that can handle massive volumes of unstructured text.

This project builds a **distributed big data NLP and machine learning pipeline** to analyze over **3.6 billion Reddit comments** and **567 million submissions** across **15 AI-focused subreddits** over a 14-month window. The pipeline was deployed on a **multi-node Apache Spark cluster** on AWS EC2 (1 master, 3 workers), enabling high-throughput ETL processing, distributed NLP transformations, and parallel ML model training on datasets exceeding local-memory constraints.

The goal of this analysis is twofold:

1. **Capture large-scale patterns** in public discourse during a pivotal moment of AI mainstream adoption  
   — sentiment trends, topic emergence, community segmentation, and engagement cycles.

2. **Design a reproducible, cloud-scalable ML architecture** demonstrating industry-relevant distributed engineering skills, particularly for text-heavy workloads.

By combining PySpark MLlib, lexicon-based sentiment analysis, topic modeling (LDA), multi-class classification, and temporal pattern extraction, this project reveals how AI discussions evolved across highly technical and general-consumer Reddit communities. More broadly, it demonstrates how distributed NLP systems can be applied to real-world, high-volume social data to extract meaningful structure at scale.

# Distributed Computing Infrastructure

## Cluster Deployment & Configuration
- Multi-node Apache Spark cluster (1 master, 3 workers) on AWS EC2  
- Automated provisioning using shell scripts  
- IAM role integration + S3A support for parquet-based distributed access  
- Security groups configured for Spark UI, SSH, inter-node communication  

## ETL Pipeline
- Processed **280M+ records** on cluster  
- Applied partition-based parallelism and caching optimization  
- Implemented fault tolerance for node failures and long-running jobs  

---

# NLP Pipeline (PySpark MLlib)

- Distributed regex text cleaning  
- Tokenization + custom stopword filtering  
- Lexicon-based sentiment scoring using vectorized Pandas UDFs  
- TF–IDF + LDA topic modeling on 20K sampled documents  
- Temporal sentiment/discussion pattern extraction (hourly/daily cycles)  

---

# Machine Learning Classification

## Feature Engineering
- TF–IDF vectorization  
- LDA topic distributions  
- Temporal features (day of week, hour, month)  
- Text length–based metrics  

## Models Trained
- Logistic Regression (L2 penalty)  
- Random Forest (50 trees, depth 10)  
- Linear SVC (One-vs-Rest for multi-class tasks)  
- MLP classifier (128 → 64 hidden layers)  

## Evaluation
- Stratified train/test split  
- Accuracy, F1, weighted precision/recall  
- Feature importance analysis (word-level, tree-based)

# Technical Implementation

- Full Spark ML Pipeline: CountVectorizer → IDF → VectorAssembler → StandardScaler  
- Pandas UDF parallelization for fast sentiment computations  
- Model persistence using Spark save APIs  
- Outputs exported to CSV for downstream visualization in Quarto  

---

# Impact

- Detected community segmentation between technical AI groups and general-user groups  
- Identified temporal peaks in engagement (late-night posting, release-driven spikes)  
- Revealed dominant topics such as model capabilities, safety debates, prompt engineering, copyright concerns, and economic anxieties  
- Captured sentiment variation across subreddits and over time, showing nuanced shifts in optimism vs skepticism as AI systems evolved

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates that large-scale social media analysis requires both **distributed systems engineering** and **advanced NLP techniques** to reveal meaningful insights hidden within billions of text records. By leveraging Apache Spark, AWS EC2, and scalable Python-based NLP operations, the pipeline efficiently processed multi-terabyte datasets that would have been infeasible on a single machine.

The findings highlight that discourse around AI is not monolithic: technical communities focus heavily on model performance, benchmarks, and deployment challenges, while general-audience subreddits express broader themes such as job displacement, creativity, safety concerns, and AI’s societal impact. Temporal analysis further shows that community sentiment evolves alongside real-world AI releases and news events.

This system provides a blueprint for large-scale online discourse monitoring—an approach increasingly relevant as AI adoption grows and public conversations become both more complex and more consequential. The architecture can be extended to real-time monitoring, predictive modeling of discussion dynamics, or comparative studies across social platforms.

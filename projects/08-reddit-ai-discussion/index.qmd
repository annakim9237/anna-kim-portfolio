## Overview
This project analyzes large-scale Reddit discussions related to artificial intelligence to understand how topics, language, and timing influence user engagement and content virality. Using distributed data processing and NLP techniques, I examined patterns across multiple AI-focused subreddits and compared AI discourse with politically influenced discussions.

## What I Did
- Engineered temporal engagement features (day-of-week, hour-of-day) to analyze posting behavior and engagement dynamics.
- Aggregated and processed billions of Reddit rows using PySpark to enable scalable analysis across 15 AI-related subreddits.
- Built an NLP pipeline using regex-based UDFs, tokenization, and `CountVectorizer` to prepare text data for modeling.
- Trained and compared dual 15-topic LDA models to contrast AI-focused discourse with politically influenced narratives.
- Developed regression and classification models (Lasso, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosted Trees) using TF–IDF features, topic vectors, and metadata.

## Methods & Tools
PySpark · Python · NLP · LDA Topic Modeling · TF–IDF · Logistic Regression · Gradient Boosted Trees · Distributed Computing · Feature Engineering

## Key Results
- Identified optimal engagement windows by analyzing posting time versus score and comment activity.
- Revealed distinct thematic differences between AI-centric discussions and politically influenced discourse through topic modeling.
- Demonstrated that linguistic features and topic composition are strong predictors of Reddit post virality.

## Impact
This project demonstrates the application of scalable NLP and machine learning techniques to real-world social media data, highlighting how data-driven insights can explain online engagement patterns and information diffusion at scale.

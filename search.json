    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThe Face Detect Follow Robot is an autonomous human-tracking system that recognizes, identifies, and physically follows a specific user in real time. Unlike simple motion-following robots, this project focuses on identity-aware tracking, meaning the robot only follows a registered person instead of anyone appearing in front of the camera. This capability is achieved through a hybrid perception system combining classical computer vision, deep-learning detection, head-pose analysis, and embedded robot control.\nThe robot begins by registering the target user’s face using Haar Cascade detection. Thirty aligned face images are collected for identity matching. During operation, the system continuously detects faces, extracts features, compares them with the registered target, and only activates “follow mode” after multiple consecutive matches ensure stable identification.\nTo handle natural human movement—such as turning the head, rotating the face, or temporarily looking away—the system integrates head pose estimation, adjusting follow direction based on the nose’s relative position. When the target’s face becomes occluded or leaves the camera view, the robot switches to YOLOv8 full-body tracking, maintaining pursuit until the face reappears. This multimodal pipeline ensures reliable tracking even in difficult visual conditions.\nMovement decisions are derived from the target’s horizontal offset from the frame center and the apparent face size relative to distance. Commands are transmitted to an Arduino-controlled robot via serial communication, enabling smooth forward, backward, and lateral motion.\nOverall, this project demonstrates how classical vision, deep-learning detection, and embedded control can be combined to produce a natural, adaptive, human-aware robotic behavior suitable for personal assistance, education, and security applications."

Through multimodal perception—face alignment, head pose estimation, YOLO fallback detection—the robot maintains stable pursuit across varied visual conditions and natural human behavior.\nThis project highlights the importance of combining interpretability, robustness, and real-time performance in human-centered robotics. While already highly functional, future improvements such as FaceNet embedding-based recognition, ROS navigation, obstacle avoidance, or voice-command integration would further expand its capabilities into a fully autonomous, socially aware robotic system."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nEnsuring safe and habitable housing is an essential component of urban governance—especially in densely populated cities like Toronto, where aging infrastructure and socioeconomic disparities directly influence building quality. RentSafeTO is the city’s primary regulatory program for assessing rental apartment safety, covering a wide range of compliance categories including structural integrity, fire protection, pest management, waste disposal, lighting, ventilation, and general maintenance.\nHowever, the official inspection process is slow, reactive, and resource-intensive. Most renters and landlords must wait months before receiving inspection outcomes, and inspectors cannot feasibly assess thousands of properties at once. This creates a need for proactive, data-driven models that estimate building safety risk before formal inspections occur, allowing informed decision-making for renters, landlords, and municipal agents.\nThis project develops a comprehensive machine learning pipeline analyzing 11,760 Toronto apartment buildings across 40 structural, historical, and environmental features provided through Toronto Open Data. The system predicts RentSafeTO safety outcomes—pass vs fail or high-risk vs compliant—using classical machine learning models paired with targeted feature engineering and imbalance mitigation strategies.\nThe pipeline explores both regression and classification paradigms, using models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Decision Trees with SMOTE, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Although regression models show extremely high goodness-of-fit (R² up to 0.98), they fail to capture the unique structure of RentSafeTO scoring—where perfect evaluations map to 100 points regardless of underlying weighted components. Instead, the SMOTE-enhanced decision tree classification approach provides a more interpretable, reliable, and balanced predictive framework, especially given the severe class imbalance in safety failures.\nUltimately, this project demonstrates how regulatory datasets—often noisy, biased, and imbalanced—can be transformed into actionable safety insights that support tenants, policymakers, and property managers. It illustrates the practical challenges of urban analytics while showing how machine learning can augment existing inspection systems to improve equity, efficiency, and public well-being."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis project demonstrates how machine learning can support regulatory systems by predicting building-level safety risks in a clear, interpretable, and operationally useful manner. Despite the inherent challenges of highly imbalanced datasets and the rigid scoring structure of RentSafeTO, the SMOTE-enhanced decision tree achieves balanced, realistic performance that aligns with real-world use cases. The model provides transparent, rule-based insights into why a building might be at risk—making it more useful to tenants, landlords, and policymakers than purely numerical regression models.\nThe results reveal important structural patterns in Toronto’s rental market: older buildings, tall complexes, and properties with repeated historical violations show higher risk. Meanwhile, geographic disparities suggest that socioeconomic factors at the ward level may influence building maintenance quality and inspection frequency.\nMore broadly, this project illustrates that urban safety analytics requires both technical rigor and social awareness. Machine learning alone cannot solve regulatory gaps, but it can dramatically enhance visibility into housing conditions, making data-driven governance more efficient and equitable. Future improvements—such as collecting more failure cases, integrating geospatial features, or applying gradient boosting methods—would further strengthen predictive performance and support fairer housing outcomes across Toronto."
